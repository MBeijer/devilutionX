How to compile:

	A Morphos machine with SDK 3.12 and mos2wos_lite 13.
  
    Cmake requires some link libs to be copied from /gg/ppc-warpos/newlib/lib/ to /gg/ppc-warpos/lib/ ( SDL, SLD_*, freetype, etc ).

    cd to build/  and call cmake with "cmake .. -DWARPOS=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=CMake/amiga/ppc-warpos.cmake"
	
	To compile for 8 bit screenmode, change SDL1_VIDEO_MODE_BPP to 8 (CMakeLists.txt)
